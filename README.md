# Spam Email Classification using NLP and Machine Learning
The Spam Email Classification Application uses machine learning algorithms to distinguish between legitimate emails and spam. This application analyzes email content, subject lines, sender information, and other metadata to identify patterns and characteristics typical of spam. By training on vast datasets of both spam and non-spam emails, the application learns to predict the likelihood of incoming messages being spam. This helps users maintain cleaner inboxes, reduces the risk of phishing attacks, and enhances overall email security by filtering out unwanted or malicious messages before they reach the recipient.

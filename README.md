# Spam Detection with NLP and Machine Learning

This project implements a **Spam Detection** system using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning (ML)**. It uses a combination of text preprocessing techniques and machine learning classifiers to predict whether a given email or text is spam or not.

## Features
- **Data Processing:**
  - Text cleaning (lemmatization, stopword removal, etc.)
  - Named Entity Recognition (NER) using SpaCy.
- **Machine Learning:**
  - Multiple models: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, KNN.
  - Voting mechanism for spam classification.
- **User Interface:**
  - Built with Streamlit for real-time interaction.
  - Accepts manual text input or file upload.
  - Displays predictions and model-specific probabilities with visualizations.
